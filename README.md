In this repository you can find documents and simulations done during my research internship in inria grenoble.
The main subject is numerical optimization for frictional problems. Variational inequalities and complementarity problems with some acceleration methods such as accelerated projected gratient descent and gauss-seidel accelerate method are the mathematical tools that I used.
