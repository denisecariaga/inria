In this repository you can find documents and simulations done during my research internship in inria grenoble.
The main subject is numerical optimization for frictional problems. Variational inequalities and complementarity problems with some acceleration methods such as accelerated projected gratient descent and gauss-seidel accelerate method are the mathematical tools that I used.

In order to run this simulation, go to the APGD_Nesterov and run:
1. simulation.py for simple APGD
2. simulation_var1 for APGD with updatind rho and ratio rule 1
3. simulation_var2 for APGD with updatind rho and ratio rule 2

There you can change the number of iterations if you please.
